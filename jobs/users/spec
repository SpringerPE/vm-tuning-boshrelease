  Users job manages users on a server. It allows defining several public keys,
  the password, uid, ssh and sudo access, shell, the profile and a way to 
  disable a user.

properties:
  users:
    description: |
      Array of user hashes. Each user should specify a `name` attribute, and 
      `crypted_password` or `public_key`. Users will not be deleted if
      they are removed from this list after a successful update, but you can
      disable them. Authorized keys for the users will be overwritten with the
      public keys you specify.
    example:
      users:
      - name: user1
        uid: 1010
        disable: false
        shell: "/bin/bash"
        comment: "test user"
        sudo: true
        ssh: true
        # mkpasswd -m sha-512 <PASSWORD> <SALT>
        crypted_password: $6$saltysalt$eF06vmEKaMhOr8jcnyfJJGuaU/Khq3DpH4M/7T.ziGNjhEEv3o9tgaX5VciMGAbgfE0CH9XrcpHi9kgmVv1Z2.
        public_key: ssh-rsa AAAA ...
      - name: user2
        sudo: true
        public_key:
         - ssh-rsa AAAA ...
         - ssh-rsa AAAA ...
